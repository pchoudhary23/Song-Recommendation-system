# Song Recommendation System

This project was part of CSE6242 coursework at Georgia Tech. It was completed while working with 3 other fellow batchmates.

The outcome of the project was a Tableau UI for song recommendation based on collaborative filtering with Python Backend and TabPy integration. The product would take user's spoitfy user id as an input and would generate a personalised playlist. The key feature of the product was mood controls, a toggle bar which allowed the users to update their personalised playlist as per their mood, and explainibility views, a group of charts helping the user to understand the recommended playlist attributes and the source of its origination( how the recommendations were made).

The data generation process used listening session histories of 1K users and 100k songs to create user-song interaction matrix. The recommendations were generated using collaborative filtering algorithm, to recommend songs listened by closely associated listeners from the training corpus.
